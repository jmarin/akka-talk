# The Reactive Manifesto

## _"Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM."_

---

# Actor Model

* Objects which encapsulate state and behavior
* Can only communicate with them by sending messages
* Mailbox (message queue) => process one message at a time
* They *share nothing* with other actors
* Event based processes, very lightweight. ~400 bytes in memory, millions / GB of RAM
* _Location Transparency_ => Distributable across a cluster of machines
* Two types of messages:
  - ! (bang operator) Fire and forget, returns inmmediately.
  - ? (ask operator) sends message and returns a Future representing a possible reply at a later point in time

# Fault Tolerance

Actors form _supervision hierarchies_.

# Actors

Hello World:

```scala

case object Greeting

class HelloActor extends Actor {
  def receive = {
    case Greeting => println("Hello World")
    case _ => "I don't understand this message"
  }
}
```

In order to run this we need an `ActorSystem` (runtime) and we need to start the actor:

```scala
val system = ActorSystem("system")
val helloActor = system.actorOf(Props[HelloActor], "hello-actor")

```

Now we can send messages to it:

```scala
helloActor ! Greeting
```
